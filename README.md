**Babl** is a high-performance, scalable web-socket server designed for use in low-latency applications.

Built from the ground up to provide blazing fast execution speeds,
**Babl** will comfortably handle high-throughput, large session-count workloads without slowing down.

Using an event-driven reactive programming model, your application code is executed in an 
allocation-free, lock-free event-loop for maximum efficiency and mechanical sympathy.
